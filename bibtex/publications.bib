	Abstract = {Rho is a ring-shaped hexameric motor protein that translocates along nascent mRNA transcript and terminates transcription of select genes in bacteria. Using a numerical optimization algorithm that simultaneously fits all of the presteady-state ATPase kinetic data, we determine how Rho utilizes the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate RNA. A random hydrolysis mechanism is ruled out by the observed inhibition of ATPase in a mixed hexamer containing wt and an inactive Rho mutant. We propose a mechanism in which (1) all six subunits are catalytically competent and hydrolyze ATP sequentially, (2) translocation of RNA is driven by the weak to tight binding transition of nucleotide in the catalytic site, (3) hydrolysis is coordinated between adjacent subunits by the transmission of stress via the catalytic arginine finger, (4) hydrolysis weakens the affinity of a subunit for RNA, and (5) the slow release of inorganic phosphate is controlled by changes in circumferential stress around the ring.},

	Abstract = {Sliding clamps are toroidal proteins that encircle DNA and act as mobile platforms for DNA replication and repair machinery. To be loaded onto DNA, the eukaryotic sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) must be splayed open at one of the subunit-subunit interfaces by the ATP-dependent clamp loader, Replication Factor C, whose clamp-interacting sites form a right-handed spiral. Earlier molecular dynamics (MD) studies suggested that when PCNA opens, it preferentially adopts a right-handed spiral to match the spiral of the clamp loader. Here, analysis of considerably longer MD simulations shows that although the opened form of PCNA can achieve conformations matching the helical pitch of Replication Factor C, it is not biased toward a right-handed spiral structure. A coarse-grained elastic model was also built; its strong correspondence to the all-atom MD simulations of PCNA suggests that the behavior of the open clamp is primarily due to elastic deformation governed by the topology of the clamp domains. The elastic model was further used to construct the energy landscape of the opened PCNA clamp, including conformations that would allow binding to the clamp loader and loading onto double-stranded DNA. A picture of PCNA emerges of a rather flexible protein that, once opened, is mechanically compliant in the clamp opening process.},

@article{Kashlan2011Constraint-based-hom,
	Abstract = {The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) mediates Na(+) transport across high resistance epithelia. This channel is assembled from three homologous subunits with the majority of the protein's mass found in the extracellular domains. Acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) is homologous to ENaC, but a key functional domain is highly divergent. Here we present molecular models of the extracellular region of α ENaC based on a large data set of mutations that attenuate inhibitory peptide binding in combination with comparative modeling based on the resolved structure of ASIC1. The models successfully rationalized the data from the peptide binding screen. We engineered new mutants that had not been tested based on the models and successfully predict sites where mutations affected peptide binding. Thus, we were able to confirm the overall general fold of our structural models. Further analysis suggested that the α subunit-derived inhibitory peptide affects channel gating by constraining motions within two major domains in the extracellular region, the thumb and finger domains.},

@article{Adelman2011Simulations-of-the-a,
	Abstract = {Sodium coupled cotransporters of the five-helix inverted repeat (5HIR) superfamily use an alternating access mechanism to transport a myriad of small molecules across the cell membrane. One of the primary steps in this mechanism is the conformational transition from a state poised to bind extracellular substrates to a state that is competent to deliver substrate to the cytoplasm. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the 5HIR benzylhydantoin transporter Mhp1 that incorporates experimental structures of the outward- and inward-open states to investigate the mechanism of this conformational change. Using the weighted ensemble path-sampling method, we rigorously sample the outward- to inward-facing transition path ensemble. The transition path ensemble reveals a heterogeneous set of pathways connecting the two states and identifies two modes of transport: one consistent with a strict alternating access mechanism and another where decoupling of the inner and outer gates causes the transient formation of a continuous permeation pathway through the transporter. We also show that the conformational switch between the outward- and inward-open states results from rigid body motions of the hash motif relative to the substrate bundle, supporting the rocking bundle hypothesis. Finally, our methodology provides the groundwork for more chemically detailed investigations of the alternating mechanism.},
